# Jon's Mech RPG

> An awesome project, brought to you by Pantone's color of 2007


You can see the source code for this site at:

You can make edits to the document itself and make a pull request the same way we did when working on GMF. **This is more robust and more difficult to break**, though, so don't worry about making a new branch unless you're trying out different versions of your lore/rules. The changes won't go through until I've accepted them so don't be surprised if it's not instant.

## Making Changes 

I added a main page and a lore page. You can edit those pages directly. If you don't want to worry about markdown that's fine, but if you want to try it out you can use this [Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/).

**Quick formatting:** spaces between lines make paragraphs. using "# " in front of a line makes is a header. more "#" means a smaller header. `# Header Title` would be the biggest,  `## Header Title` would be smaller, and so on. using `**Feed Me**` will result in **Feed Me**. `*Seymour*` will result in *Seymour*.

If you want to add a new page you just add a new file with the ".md" extension. In order for it to show up in the sidebar, you'll need to add it to the "-sidebar.md" file. there are a few items in there already so you can just follow their lead.

> Quick Example

If I wanted to create a new page for mech types called "Mech Types" I'd create a file called "mech_types.md" (this could be anything) and then go to the "_sidebar.md" and add 

`[Mech Types](mech_types.md)` to the file.
